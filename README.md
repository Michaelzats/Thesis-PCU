Thesis Name:
Automating News Article Classification with Machine Learning Based on Document Classification Aspects

Projects includes:
* PART 1 (Google Colab Project Part)
* PART 2 (App Deployment with streamlit)

  
PART 1 (Google Colab Project Part)
Google Colab Link ( https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1d_RZR8xhiVBPSOCMJKwHvPtWBXE6nAVQ?usp=sharing )

Description:
This project aims to classify a diverse set of documents into predefined categories using various machine learning and deep learning models.


Installation:
Prerequisites:
* Python 3
* Google Colab (for running the provided notebook)

Installation steps:
* Clone the repository from Google Colab. (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1j-RytXdZDXCAWKHlaQdFWmRo64SJt_3Y?usp=sharing) In Colab click File --> Save a copy in Colab.

Usage:
Basic examples:
* Load the dataset provided “dataset (10)Dataset Text Document Classification.zip” for part 1 “Dataset BBC Full Text Document Classification.zip” for part 2 and “Data_For_the_App_Training.zip” for part 3 in the project PART 1 in Google Colab. You can do it by clicking on the file folder icon from the right in Colab and then draging “example.zip” File into the opened part.  Example how to drag “example.zip” into the file folder <img width="573" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 21 19 02" src="https://github.com/Michaelzats/ICA-ML/assets/92814061/fd7286c6-8529-4340-8c94-19580c6a57a7">
Do not unzip it before the excucution, the command # Once uploaded, unzip using: “!unzip example.zip !ls” will do it.
* Train the model using the provided training set.
* Evaluate the model using the test set.

Detailed examples:
* The notebook provides detailed steps for implementing and evaluating each model.

Features:
* Classification of documents into predefined categories.
* Evaluation based on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.
* Use of various machine learning (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree and Random Forest) and deep learning model (Deep Neural Network).

Limitations:
* The prototype is recommended to be run in Google Colab as it was created there and can not be simply transferred to the other environment 
* The prototype is computationally heavy, therefore it takes long time to run it through. For the “Dataset BBC Full Text Document Classification.zip” and “Data_For_the_App_Training.zip” datasets execution, google colab pro is required as the datasets are too large and require additional RAM
* The prototype was done on MAC OS environment, therefore should you have any problems with running it on other environments, please contact mikhail.zats@praguecollege.cz

Testing:
* The models are evaluated using the test set provided in the dataset.
* Evaluation metrics include Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.
