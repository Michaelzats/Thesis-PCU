Usage:
Basic examples:
* Load the dataset provided “dataset (10)Dataset Text Document Classification.zip” for part 1 “Dataset BBC Full Text Document Classification.zip” for part 2 and “Data_For_the_App_Training.zip” for part 3 in the project PART 1 in Google Colab. You can do it by clicking on the file folder icon from the right in Colab and then draging “example.zip” File into the opened part.  Example how to drag “DATASETS.zip” into the file folder as an example <img width="173" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-01 at 13 18 06" src="https://github.com/Michaelzats/Thesis-PCU/assets/92814061/e0d7a980-f8c6-4f56-867d-c102ae981ab4">



* Do not unzip it before the excucution, the command # Once uploaded, unzip using: “!unzip example.zip !ls” will do it.
* Train the model using the provided training set.
* Evaluate the model using the test set.

Detailed examples:
* The notebook provides detailed steps for implementing and evaluating each model.

Features:
* Classification of documents into predefined categories.
* Evaluation based on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.
* Use of various machine learning (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree and Random Forest) and deep learning model (Deep Neural Network).

Limitations:
* The prototype is recommended to be run in Google Colab as it was created there and can not be simply transferred to the other environment 
* The prototype is computationally heavy, therefore it takes long time to run it through. For the “Dataset BBC Full Text Document Classification.zip” and “Data_For_the_App_Training.zip” datasets execution, google colab pro is required as the datasets are too large and require additional RAM
* The prototype was done on MAC OS environment, therefore should you have any problems with running it on other environments, please contact mikhail.zats@praguecollege.cz

Testing:
* The models are evaluated using the test set provided in the dataset.
* Evaluation metrics include Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.

**PART 2 (App Deployment with streamlit)**

App Link ( https://thesis-pcu-fm4qprwzd3mqu859qynczv.streamlit.app/ )

(Manual coping method)
Installation:
Prerequisites:
* GIthub
* streamlit Account

Installation steps:
* Upload in you GitHub
  * app.py
  * requirements.txt
  * svm_model.pkl
  * tfidf_vectorizer.pkl
* Connect with streamlit Account to host


Usage:
Basic examples: Upload any articles by coping the text and pusting, link url or .txt file to identify which out of business, entertainment, politics, sport, and technology topics is your text about.

(Automated method) 
Go through that link https://thesis-pcu-fm4qprwzd3mqu859qynczv.streamlit.app/ and Upload any articles by coping the text and pusting, link url or .txt file to identify which out of business, entertainment, politics, sport, and technology topics is your text about.

Features:

Classification of documents into predefined categories.
Use of best identified in part machine learning (Support Vector Machines (SVM) without enhancements.

Limitations:

The app is able to identify only business, entertainment, politics, sport, and technology topics.
The app may have a better accuracy for business compared to other topics
Topics identification based on the link URL may not work once the websites the links from have some kind of protection

Testing:

The app is evaluated using the real 20 articles articles from BBC, 20 from CNN, 20 from USN, 20 from euronews and 20 from abcnews (overall 100 articles) for each category.
Evaluation metric is Accuracy.
